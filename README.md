# pygame-shotting
This is a small survival game inspired by Brotato, built using Python and Pygame. It’s one of my early projects as I’ve been learning Python over the past couple of months, and I wanted to apply what I’ve been studying to something interactive and game-focused.

The project explores core game development concepts such as player movement, enemy behavior, combat systems, and upgrades. Building it has helped me better understand how game loops, collisions, and basic mechanics work in practice.

Throughout development, I’ve used tutorials, official documentation, and AI tools to guide my learning and solve challenges along the way.  

In the future, I’d like to expand this idea further — possibly rebuilding or refining it using a game engine like Unity or Godot to create a more polished version.

This project is mainly about learning by building and growing step by step as a developer.
